Welcome to our attempt at Project Three! 

The purpose of project 3 is to apply the knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & DOM to create a simple game application! 

**RULES**

Guess a number between 1 and 100.

The program will generate a secret number which will be first hidden to the audience.

Players need to guess the number and check the result/hint by typing the number into a
box (input element) then clicking on the check button.

Want to give it a go? Download the repository and take a crack at it! Although remember, the computer always wins!
